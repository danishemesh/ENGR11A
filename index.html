    <p>The first print is a 3D print of my name Daniel Shemesh as a name tag.</p>

        <h2>Second 3D Print: Calibration Test</h2>
        <p>The second 3D print is designed to push the limits of the machine. I chose to print out a rifleman rfl-8d which is also known as a computer game character. The issue I saw with this print was that the arms were too long - more than a 45-degree angle.</p>

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>Post reflection Thikercad Project - I used to work with solid works for 3D designing before,so I had to get used to TinkerCad but turns out it is a very simple 3D designing tool. While thinking of a design to combine two designs into one my main personal goal in mind was to make a product that would be useful, functional and that I would love to use. I'm really proud of how my final design turned out. Itâ€™s highly functional, allowing for both pen storage and serving as a phone stand. I find my designs to be super functional and efficient as you can store pens and also stand your phone.Beyond its practicality, I also aimed to add an element of fun and creativity, making it more than just a typical, everyday design.</p>

    <h3>Post reflection</h3>
    <p>Coming to ENGR 11A, I was very excited to learn how to 3D print and design different objects. In the nametag project, I had much fun creating my first-ever 3D print and succeeding on my very first try. On the other hand, the second print was a lot more complicated. I did many tries but still haven't succeeded in finding a print that will fit the requirements perfectly. While searching intensively for a new print, I at last found a perfect sort of action figure-looking print that ended up being my final print. One of my future goals is to become an entrepreneur, make different products that will solve problems, and make the world a better place. While being in this class, my expectations have excited as we are learning not just about designing but also about creating a website. This leaves me with a feeling that I am getting closer and closer to making my dream a reality.</p>
