        <p>The first print is a 3D print of my name, Daniel Shemesh, as a name tag.</p>

        <h2>Second 3D Print: Calibration Test</h2>
        <p>The second 3D print is designed to push the limits of the machine. I chose to print out a rifleman rfl-8d, which is also known as a computer game character. The issue I saw with this print was that the arms were too long—more than a 45-degree angle.</p>

        <h3>Post reflection</h3>
        <p>Coming to ENGR 11A, I was very excited to learn how to 3D print and design different objects. In the nametag project, I had much fun creating my first-ever 3D print and succeeding on my very first try. On the other hand, the second print was more complicated. I did many tries but still haven’t succeeded in finding a print that will meet the requirements perfectly. In the end, I found an action figure-looking print that became my final project. One of my future goals is to become an entrepreneur, creating products that solve problems and make the world a better place. This class has exceeded my expectations, and I feel like I’m getting closer to my dream.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: TinkerCAD - Phone Pen Holder</h2>
        <p>Post reflection TinkerCAD Project - I used to work with solid works for 3D designing before, so I had to get used to TinkerCAD but turns out it is a very simple 3D designing tool. While thinking of a design to combine two designs into one my main personal goal in mind was to make a product that would be useful, functional and that I would love to use. I'm really proud of how my final design turned out. It’s highly functional, allowing for both pen storage and serving as a phone stand. I find my designs to be super functional and efficient as you can store pens and also stand your phone. Beyond its practicality, I also aimed to add an element of fun and creativity, making it more than just a typical, everyday design.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Fusion 360 - Phone Pen Holder</h2>
        <p>Post reflection Project Fusion - Working with Fusion was an interesting experience. Fusion seems to have an obvious advantage over TinkerCAD as there are more functions we can use for our designing. I found it very complicated to use because there were so many functions. My main goal in the second design was to take my first design and make it more professional and simpler so people could use it in the workspace. Another consideration I had is that I wanted a more stable phone holder. When using it I find it very useful whether I am watching a video and reflecting on it or if I am working and using the stand to play music on my phone.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Alarm Clock Holder</h2>
        <p>Post reflection Project 3 - Coming into this project, I was very excited about the idea of building an alarm clock for the first time in my life! I felt that this would be one of the most exciting projects we did so far. Throughout the process, I experienced both challenges and successes, but I am proud to have completed it in the end. During this project I worked with my teammate, Charlie. We were working very efficiently together, and I really enjoyed working with him. We worked well together, and it made the project feel much more manageable. The most difficult part was the design phase, particularly using Fusion 360. The software presents a steep learning curve, but I found that overcoming these challenges helped me build my skills further. ENGR 11A class keeps surprising me. The work is not easy but the end result is very rewarding and gives me a sense of accomplishment.</p>
        
        <h2>Soldering an alarm clock</h2>
        <p>Soldering an alarm clock was a very interesting experience. As someone doing it for the first time, I really find it satisfying to solder.</p>

        <h2>Alarm clock holder</h2>
        <p>This part of the project was a bit tricky since our first print had one false measurement (the side was too short), so we had to redo the sketch. At last, we got our final product!</p>

                                <h2>Alarm clock holder Designing</h2>
        <p>In This step we we had to take mesurments of all the mesures of the alarm clock and na=batterie case for getting the specific detailes for a perfect design. </p>

                <h2>Laser cutting </h2>
        <p>This faze was very hard we had to figure out how to build our sketch from zero and make it in a dxf format for the laser cutting. one of our biggest challanges was understanding simple principles of working with fusion like mirroing or parrallel figurs. With the help of our Proffesor and TA's we have succeded to create out first laser cutted Alarm Clock Holder!!! </p>

                        <p> Unfortunately our first laser cut was not succesgull interms of size: It was just too small to fit. </p>

                <h2>Laser cutting Final cut number 2 </h2>
        <p>Laser cutting 2 - IN This step we decided to take a diffrent approach. Instead of recreating the whole sketch we decided to adjust by 103 % the size of the holder and it succefully worked. </p>

        <h2>Project 4: 3D-Printed e-NABLE Prosthesis</h2>
        <p>In this project I used Mini perusal plus 3D printer, PLA filament. Used Perusa slicer for editing and slicing the 3D print. I used the design of thee-ENABLE Phoenix Hand v3 prosthetic hand (taken from  e-NABLEhub-RecommendedDevices) at 150% scale. Also we used a hitting toll to heat the part of the wrist of the print so it will have a special curve that fits an arm. Moreover we connected all the parts together with a special kit we got that contained screws, cable, plastic finger covers and rubber bands.</p>
        <p>During this process we faced as a team many challenges. Some of the challenges were logistic problems such as finding a printer to print since so many groups had a lot of prints to print. On the other hand we faced some difficulties with 150% scale which made the screws that are supposed to go inside the arm supporters too small for it to fit so they were completely loose. We did find a solution which is not perfect but it works: we set up the cable holders on the side and then fit them in so they are holding on to both sides of the print and do not slide out.</p>
        <p>We reviewed two different types of documentation; videos and written manuals. While reviewing we started with the written manual as we thought it would be faster and more efficient than watching the video since it was 36 minutes. After starting to read the manual we understood it would be much easier to watch the video since the video explains and shows a physical example of what we should do. I would suggest for the current documentation to add specific time frames to each step of the video that way we could be more time efficient and skip to the next step we need to complete. </p>
